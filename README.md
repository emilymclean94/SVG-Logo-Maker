## Description
This project was created to take user input in the CLI and generate a logo via svg file. The user is prompted with questions asking what text, text color, shape, and shape color they would like to use for their logo. Once the user finishes the prompts, they receive a confirmation message in the console and the svg file is save in an 'outputs' folder.

## Usage
Make sure you have the necessary packages installed. This project specifically uses the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) package. Once you have the necessary packages, open the terminal in your code editing software. Type in the command 'node index.js' and answer the following prompts. Once you have answered all prompts, you will see a message that says "SVG file has been created" logged in the console. Your generated logo will be located in the Output folder within the 'assets' with the file name 'logo.svg'. Lastly, open in a Live Server to view your new logo!
